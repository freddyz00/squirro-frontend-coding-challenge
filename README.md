## Squirro Frontend Coding Challenge

This repo contains two folders that constitute each other to create an application that lists the best-selling books for each book store. The book-store-api folder contains the JSON:API based server which provides the data for the book stores. The book-store-frontend folder contains the responsive React application that displays the data according to the requirements of the coding challenge.
